      <h3>About the CSD</h3>
      <p>The
        <abbr title="Christopher Street Days">CSD's</abbr> in germany do not take place on the historical date, June 28th, but on the weekends from June to August.
        The event has to be registered as a demonstration and it is planned, organized and carried out by individuals and
        social clubs contributing voluntarily.
      </p>
      <p>
        The CSDs are also regarded as a political demonstration with a policy-related motto, usually shown up in the form of demonstration
        parades and a subsequent rally. Often the rally is supported by artists performing on stage.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition to the political message of the CSD is celebrated. This celebration of one's own lifestyle is based on the origins
        of the CSD: The participants often demonstratively demonstrate that they are proud of themselves, their lives and
        their sexual identity.

      <p>
        The CSD recalls the first known uprising of homosexuals and other sexual minorities against police arbitrariness on New York's
        Christopher Street in the Greenwich Village neighborhood: in the early hours of June 28, 1969, the so-called Stonewall
        Uprising took place in the Stonewall Inn bar.
      </p>
      <p>
        At that time there were repeated violent raids of the police in pubs with homosexual target audience. It came in the episode
        to days of street battles between homosexuals and the police. To commemorate the first anniversary of the uprising,
        the Christopher Street Liberation Day Committee was established.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since then, in New York on the last Saturday of June, the Christopher Street Liberation Day, a street parade commemorates
        this event. It has become an international tradition to hold a demonstration for the rights of gays and lesbians
        in the summer. In Berlin, Cologne and other major German cities, these demonstrations are held each year as Christopher
        Street Day or "CSD" for short.
      </p>
      <p>
        In Germany, the first CSDs took place under this name in 1979, located in Berlin and Bremen. Larger lesbian and gay demonstrations
        have been around since 1972 (the first in the Federal Republic of Germany on April 29, 1972 in MÃ¼nster).
